# MAP673 Final Map Project Expectations and Schedule

MAP673, and the New Maps Plus Certificate, culminates in an independent project of substantial work and quality. The goal of this final project is threefold:

1. challenge you to synthesize a range of technical and conceptual knowledge gained throughout the New Maps Plus courses to produce a novel and effective web map
2. provide you with a chance to procure your own data relating to a meaning topic of your choosing, and in doing so allow you to explore and experiment with additional mapping techniques not covered within course lessons
3. give you a strong portfolio piece celebrating your skills and demonstrating your talent to employers, potential clients, and the wider geospatial community

Given the right amount of effort, these maps will be competitive in national and international student interactive mapping competitions, including the [CaGIS Map Design Competition](http://www.cartogis.org/awards/contest.php) and [NACIS Student Dynamic Map Competition](http://nacis.org/awards/student-dynamic-map-competition/). The deadline for the NACIS competitions is May 31st (our maps won't be complete, but we can still register the map).

The final map will count for 35 points (35% of your entire grade for the course).

## Breakdown of deliverables

* Overview of topic (**2.5 pts**)

## Schedule of deliverables

* **May 22nd:** Overview of topic. 
* **May 29th:** Map proposal. 
* **June 5th:** Working prototype of map complete
* **June 12th:** Beta version of map complete, live-version hosted as gh-pages branch, and presentations available
* **June 19th:**  Final Map submitted and portfolio updated

## Description of deliverables

We're essentially dedicating five weeks to building and refining a final map project. The first two weeks will be more preparation for the design and development of the map, and will be done in conjunction with two slightly smaller weekly lessons/labs (CartoDB.js and D3.js). The final three weeks will be dedicated solely to the final map project.

### Overview of topic (week 06)

Includes:

* description of data topic (with an anticipated map title)
* map objectives
* user needs articulated through a persona/scenario
* data sources

### Map proposal  (week 07)

Includes deliverables submitted on the 22nd, and additionally includes:  

* identification of anticipate thematic representation (e.g., dot map, choropleth, prop symbols, etc)
* a content and requirements list (see Module 05)
* description of the anticipated user interaction (UI)
* a series of low fidelity wireframes, paper prototypes, or mockups 

### Working prototype  (week 08)

By the end of week eight we should have a working (alpha) prototype that minimally accomplishes:

* the loading of correctly formatted data into the map
* the thematic/cartographic representation of these data in a visual form
* a functional script allowing for (at least some of) the interaction routines to be completed

This prototype should be consider alpha stage. Bugs and design flaws are expected.

### Beta version and presentations (week 09)

By the end of week nine we should have a fully functional and mostly polished map to share with the class for peer review/critique. This map should be hosted in its own repository, with which a gh-pages branch can be used to share a web hosted version with the class.

Additionally, you're required to record a 10 - 12 minute presentation of your map and upload to Canvas for sharing. We'll be circulating some free/open source screen casting video software options beforehand, but consider [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) or [Jing](https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html). 

The presentation should cover the following:

* **min 1**: Introduce your topic and your motivation for the project.
* **min 2**: Briefly describe your target user, their goals and objectives for using the map.
* **mins 3 - 4**: Walk us through a live use case scenario using the map. Explain the various interface components and how the user will use them.
* **min 5**: Conclude with any features, functionality, or design aspects you'd like to attend to or improve upon for the final week (a "wish list").

The instructor will assign small teams (3 - 4) to offer peer critique of the map and feedback (i.e., a form of mock "user testing"). Student peers should provide this feedback to other team members by Tuesday at the latest, to allow for time to incorporate suggestions.

### Final map submission and portfolio updated (week 10)

The final map will be updated and submitted, and online portfolios (from MAP672) will be updated with this map and a couple more from MAP673.
