Map 673 Lab 04 - Devin Bartley
---------------

Artificial Scenario:

 Due to a strong surge in populist sentiment, a new government has been elected and one of their main promises is to implement programs to expand per capita ownership rates of livestock.The first task is to understand the spatial distribution of livestock ownership in Kenya, and then target the areas with small proportions of livestock. Because each type of livestock is unique, a map has been requested by employees of the Ministry of Agriculture to show all of the animals that are captured in the 2009 census so appropriate policy and funding can be applied to the appropriate regions.

1. Why am I making this product:
        To show a spatial distribution of livestock ownership rates per capita. The map will be used to inform policy descisions and target areas of further research.

2. What do we want to get out of this project:
        A clear demonstration of how a leaflet map can show multiple classes of information and how each class relates to space. Also a demonstration of how leaflet can be used to create a reference tool for non-technical descision makers. In essence, we want to improve on the maps that existed in print encyclopedias that showed where certain types of economic activity took place within a country.

3. What do our users want to get out of this product:
        A very clear picture of the inequalities of livestock ownership nation wide. Additionally we would like to see the breakdown by each type of livestock in order to understand where to focus resources.
