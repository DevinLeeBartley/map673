# Lab 04: Applying the User Experience to A Web Mapping Workflow

Complete the following tasks, push to your repo, and submit a URL link by the due date. See the example document *lab-04-data/example_objectives_requirements.pdf* for guidance on how to write up Task 1 and 2, though feel free to modify according to your own sensibilities.

**TASK 1:** Explore some of the other datasets available through [Kenya's open data portal](https://www.opendata.go.ke/), such as under Agriculture, Energy, or the Environment. Pick a dataset to use within this lab assignment and consider a persona/scenario to which the dataset and an accompanying map may fit.

Write a brief summary of the product objectives and user needs. Answer the following questions:

1. Why are you making this product?
2. What do we want to get out of this product?
3. What do our users want to get out of this product?

**TASK 2:** Write a summary of the functional specifications and content requirements. Answer the question: "What are you going to make?" Be specific and develop a list of content and functional requirements.  

**TASK 3:** Clean up the data you've downloaded from the Open Kenya portal and ensure it's in a format suitable for the web map. Save this file as a CSV file (if point data) or convert to a GeoJSON file (using QGIS) if areal data.

**TASK 4:** Build your index.html according to the instructions detailed above. Complete the task by getting your data loaded into the map and displayed. Note that if you chose data best represented as an areal phenomena, the omnivore.js plugin can also load and display GeoJSON structured data. Or you may wish to explore the .loadURL() method, illustrated in the example [Load GeoJSON from a URL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/geojson-marker-from-url/).

**Submission:** Your written responses to Tasks 1 and 2 may be written within a plain text (.txt) document or markdown (.md), or in some other format of your choosing (Word, PDF, etc). Submit your processed data from task 3, as well as the working *index.html* file from Task 5, as well as the *.csv* file you built from the downloaded data.
